ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

âœ… Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning algorithms. Churn prediction is crucial for businesses aiming to retain customers by identifying who is likely to leave based on past behavior and demographic data. A user-friendly web interface has been built using Streamlit, where users can input customer information and receive a churn prediction instantly.


ðŸš€ Features

- Predicts customer churn probability in real-time  
- User input form with clear field definitions  
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Supports multiple machine learning models  
- Interactive UI using **Streamlit**  
- Performance metrics evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC  
- Model optimization using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning  
- SMOTE for handling class imbalance  


ðŸ§  Technologies Used

-Python
-Streamlit
-Pandas & NumPy
-Scikit-learn
-Matplotlib & Seaborn
-Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
-Joblib for model serialization

You can download the dataset from [Kaggle - Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

ðŸŒ± Future Improvements

1.Add user login/authentication
2.Connect to a live CRM or database
3.Add more advanced models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
4.Implement auto-retraining with new data
